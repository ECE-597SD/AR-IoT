# Project-3 - User Interaction with IoT Devices using Augmented Reality
## Motivation
Current IoT solutions require a separate application for each IoT device, which makes managing and interacting with these devices tedious and challenging. 
Additionally, smart home solutions to address accessability are meant to cater to everyone. Thus, increased convience is desired.

This leads us to our solution: a one-stop-shop AR application capable of automatically detecting IoT devices that displays data from the IoT device as well as the ability to configure and control them.

## Design Goals
